# Three-Factor-Authentication-System
➢ The level-1 is the User Credentials Check- which consists of a username and a
password. In this level, the system verifies the user’s username and password. If it is
correct then the system allows the user into the second level otherwise, the system
displays an error message to the user.
➢ Level-2 is the Security Questions Check. Instead of using captcha or a codeword or
biometrics for level-2, we are going to use a randomized set of user-based questions
from which data is taken from a set of three personal questions which would be asked
to the user in the user registration system. The user has to enter the correct answer to
the random question generated by the system. If the user enters the correct answer,
he/she would proceed to the next level. If the user enters the wrong answer, he/she
would not be able to proceed to the next level and the system displays an error message
to the user.
➢ Level-3 is the OTP (One Time Password) system. Here an OTP will be sent to the user's
phone number and the user has to input his/her OTP into the system for OTP validation.
If the user enters the wrong answer, he/she would not be able to proceed to the next
level and the system displays an error message to the user. If the user enters the correct
OTP, then the system will give the user access to his information.
